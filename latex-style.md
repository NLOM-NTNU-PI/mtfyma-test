This document describes the latex style and organization that should be used.

Keep it simple! Avoid packages were possible. Use packages instead of by novel hacks. Packages should be placed in a header.tex file that is called from the main.tex file.

No manual layout adjustments in the text. All such adjustements should be done in the header.tex file. 

Comments that are permanent and pertain to structure of document or latex should be written in english. Comments that related to text to be written should be written in norwegian. The final version should thus only have english comments.

Indentation should be used for readability and tabs should be used
